## Tic Tac Toe
 
### Test Assignment 4 

Made by Sofie Amalie Landt, Amanda Juhl Hansen & Benjamin Aizen Kongshaug

#### 1. Mockito Powerups

##### How do you verify that a mock was called?
```
Import static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;

verify(mock).someMethod();

We verify that the Mockito.mock has been called with a method someMethod().
```


##### How do you verify that a mock was NOT called?
##### How do you specify how many times a mock should have been called?
##### How do you verify that a mock was called with specific arguments?
##### How do you use a predicate to verify the properties of the arguments given to a call to the mock?

#### 2. At Least One

We have decided to make Tic Tac Toe in Java with an AI that uses MiniMax. For this we have used:

- Jacoco as coverage report
- PITest as mutation testing
- FindSpots as static analysis
